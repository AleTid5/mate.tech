                    So what does the new record for the lowest level of winter
                    ice actually mean
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the
                    sea-ice then thaws every summer, and that process will
                    continue whatever happens with climate change. Even if the
                    Arctic continues to be one of the fastest-warming regions of
                    the world, it will always be plunged into bitterly cold
                    polar dark every winter. And year-by-year, for all kinds of
                    natural reasons, thereâ€™s huge variety of the state of the
                    ice.

                  <p>
                    For a start, it does not automatically follow that a record
                    amount of ice will melt this summer. More important for
                    determining the size of the annual thaw is the state of the
                    weather as the midnight sun approaches and temperatures
                    rise. But over the more than 30 years of satellite records,
                    scientists have observed a clear pattern of decline,
                    decade-by-decade.
